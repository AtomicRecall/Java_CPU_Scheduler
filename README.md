# Java_CPU_Scheduler
This is a repo of my CPU Scheduler project while I was enrolled at New York Instituite of Technology, this program uses the Round Robin type of CPU scheduling and has fake tasks that the "CPU" has to complete, all written in a seperate text file. ![README.pdf](https://github.com/AtomicRecall/Java_CPU_Scheduler/blob/main/README.pdf) contains the report I had to submit, it explains very well what my program is and how it works as well :)
